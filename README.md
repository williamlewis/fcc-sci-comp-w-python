# Scientific Computing with Python
Platform: freeCodeCamp<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Hands-On Projects:
1. **Arithmetic Formatter**
    - convert single-line arithmetic problems into multi-line format with multiple problems
    - optionally provide arithmetic solutions
    <br/>
2. **Time Calculator**
    - add a time duration to a start time, providing a result time in 12-hour AM/PM format
    - indicate number of days later for result time
    - optionally provide day of the week for result time
    <br/>
3. **Budget App**
    - create a budget `Category` class with methods to handle simple transactions across class instances (e.g. deposit, withdraw, transfer)
    - format printable string output
    - create a function to plot a simple bar chart summarizing spend percentages for multiple budget class instances
    <br/>
4. **Polygon Area Calculator**
    - create a parent class and a subclass with methods to reset dimensions, calculate size attributes, & determine number of number of polygon instances that fit within another instance
    <br/>
5. **Probability Calculator**
    - create a "Hat" class that accepts a variable number of keyword arguments for colored balls
    - create a function to experiment drawing balls from the Hat class and calculate the probability of specific draw results based on the number of experiments
