# Scientific Computing with Python (Course)

Self-guided development of mathematical apps to earn Python certificate through freeCodeCamp learning platform.

<br/>

## Hands-On Projects:
1. [**Arithmetic Formatter**](https://github.com/williamlewis/fcc-sci-comp-w-python/tree/main/Project%2001%20-%20Arithmetic%20Formatter)
    - convert single-line arithmetic problems into multi-line format with multiple problems
    - optionally provide arithmetic solutions
    
    <br/>

2. [**Time Calculator**](https://github.com/williamlewis/fcc-sci-comp-w-python/tree/main/Project%2002%20-%20Time%20Calculator)
    - add a time duration to a start time, providing a final time in 12-hour am/pm format
    - indicate number of days passed if applicable
    - optionally provide ending day of week
    
    <br/>

3. [**Budget App**](https://github.com/williamlewis/fcc-sci-comp-w-python/tree/main/Project%2003%20-%20Budget%20App)
    - create a budget `Category` class with methods to handle simple transactions across class instances (e.g. deposit, withdraw, transfer)
    - format printable string output
    - create a function to plot a simple bar chart summarizing spend percentages for multiple budget class instances
    
    <br/>

4. [**Polygon Area Calculator**](https://github.com/williamlewis/fcc-sci-comp-w-python/tree/main/Project%2004%20-%20Polygon%20Area%20Calculator)
    - create a parent class and a subclass with methods to reset dimensions, calculate size attributes, & determine number of number of polygon instances that fit within another instance
    
    <br/>

5. [**Probability Calculator**](https://github.com/williamlewis/fcc-sci-comp-w-python/tree/main/Project%2005%20-%20Probability%20Calculator)
    - create a "Hat" class that accepts variable number of keyword arguments for colored balls
    - create a function to experiment drawing balls from the Hat class and calculate probability of specific draw results based on number of experiments
